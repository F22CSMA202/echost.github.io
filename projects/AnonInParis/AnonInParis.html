                       An interactive database navigation tool using machine vision. The project is based on data collected from public library computers at the Centre Pompidou, which included query histories stemming from popular French news sources such as Le Monde and Le Figaro, search queries from dailymotion.com, and general search queries from bing.com. This data was captured in multiple ways, stemming from date, time, year, url, and string of the query.

                     I was curious about how the data was collected by the institution and wanted to visualize the data in such a way that the user was implicated in the viewing of the data. I decided to use the OpenCV library to use the internal camera built into my laptop to capture live video and use it as an input for moving between the first two columns of the data, being the session ID and date of access.
